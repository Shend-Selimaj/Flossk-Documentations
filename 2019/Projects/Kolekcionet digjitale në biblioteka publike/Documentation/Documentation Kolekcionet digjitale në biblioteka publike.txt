Title: Kolekcionet digjitale në biblioteka publike
	
Project description:

The project focuses on digitizing the "Rilindja" newspaper, published from February 12, 1945, to September 5, 1990, with an estimated 200,000 pages. Classified as an orphan work, "Rilindja" will be made publicly accessible, providing valuable resources for researchers and the general public. The project aims to develop a semi-automatic scanner and integrate a Fedora digital repository, ensuring the materials are freely accessible online. By training 30 young volunteers, the project fosters skills in digitization and preserves important historical publications. The project, with a budget of €25,000, is expected to create a sustainable model for digital preservation in public libraries.
