Title: Open Source Technologies for Geospatial Research and Development
	
Project description:
The project aimed to equip students and teachers with modern, open-source geospatial tools and methodologies for geographical studies. It focused on updating the existing curriculum in the geospatial domain with the 'Geo for All' curriculum, which included monthly activities and workshops. Throughout the project, students learned data collection, mapping, visualization, data processing, and publishing. By leveraging geospatial technology, students engaged in research projects on diverse topics, including land use mapping, urbanization, deforestation, watersheds, and flooding. This project enriched students' understanding of geographic concepts, fostering critical, analytical, and imaginative thinking skills.
