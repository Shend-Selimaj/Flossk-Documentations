Title:
Mapping Public Facilities of Kosovo

Project Description:
The "Mapping Public Facilities of Kosovo" project, supported by UNICEF Innovations Lab, aimed to map all existing public facilities in Kosovo. Despite challenges due to limited information from official sources, the project succeeded with the support of InformataZyrtare.org, a free software project that provided essential data. The mapping focused on all seven major cities in Kosovo, and the gathered data was made freely accessible on OpenStreetMap (www.osm.org). The project was carried out by eight teams of young people trained in data gathering and map editing.
