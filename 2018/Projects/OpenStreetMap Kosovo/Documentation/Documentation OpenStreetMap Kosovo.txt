OpenStreetMap Kosovo (2018)
Project Duration:
2018 – 2020

Project Description:
The OpenStreetMap (OSM) Kosovo project aimed to develop geographic information systems (GIS) and related skills in Kosovo. OpenStreetMap is a collaborative mapping platform that allows anyone to use and improve its data. This initiative focused on enhancing GIS education, expanding map coverage in Kosovo, and increasing public engagement with open mapping.

Key activities included in-depth GIS training for students, outreach programs to raise awareness and encourage participation, and the collection of street-level imagery for mapping purposes. By fostering a community of mappers and improving GIS skills, the project provided valuable resources for governmental, non-governmental, and business use while also increasing participants' employability.

Activities:
Conducted GIS training sessions for 15 participants, covering OpenStreetMap editing tools and advanced GIS software such as JOSM and QGIS.
Organized mapathons and outreach events, including OSM GEO-Week in collaboration with the University of Prishtina and meetups with local and international experts.
Signed Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) with the Kosovo Cadastral Agency and municipalities to obtain geographical data, leading to the completion of Kosovo street names on OSM.
Established the OSM Kosovo Local Chapter with support from the OpenStreetMap Foundation to expand the mapping community and improve data on settlements.
Beneficiaries:
The project benefited over 100 participants, including high school and university students, urban planners, architects, and members of the tech community. Local and international volunteers contributed to over 10,000 edits on OpenStreetMap. Additionally, high school students from 16 municipalities participated in mapathons, gaining valuable GIS skills. The OSM community in Kosovo also expanded through the State of Map Southeast Europe conference, fostering collaboration among local and international GIS professionals.
