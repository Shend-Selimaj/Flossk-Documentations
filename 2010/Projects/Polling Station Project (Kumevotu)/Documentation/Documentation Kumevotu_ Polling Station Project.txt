Kumevotu: Polling Station Project
Project Description
On December 12, 2010, FLOSSK, with financial support from UNICEF Innovations Lab, completed the Kumevotu project to assist voters in Kosovo's Parliamentary Elections of 2010. The project aimed to simplify the process of locating polling stations, especially for young voters, through an interactive website, kumevotu.info.

Using OpenStreetMap (OSM), the website provided precise polling station locations after users input their personal details. This project addressed a significant need, particularly in larger cities, where voters were often assigned polling stations far from their residences.

Activities
Conducted training courses on OpenStreetMap (OSM) and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) for students from three cities in Kosovo.
Collected, edited, and entered Points of Interest (POIs) for schools in major cities into OSM.
Converted official voter lists from PDF to CSV format for digital use.
Developed and launched the kumevotu.info website, which received 1,800 visits during the elections.
Planned to release the website code under a GPL license on GitHub.
Beneficiaries
The project directly benefited voters in Kosovo, particularly young people, by simplifying the process of locating polling stations and increasing accessibility to election information.
