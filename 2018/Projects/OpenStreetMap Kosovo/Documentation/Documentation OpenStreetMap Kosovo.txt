Title: OpenStreetMap Kosovo (2018)
	
Project description:

The OpenStreetMap (OSM) Kosovo project aims to develop geographic information systems (GIS) and related skills in Kosovo. OpenStreetMap is a collaborative map platform that allows anyone to use and improve its data. This project focuses on leveraging OSM to improve GIS education and map coverage in Kosovo. Activities include in-depth GIS training for students, outreach to increase public awareness and participation, and the gathering of street-level imagery for mapping purposes. By building a community of mappers and enhancing GIS skills, the project seeks to provide valuable resources for governmental, non-governmental, and business use, while also improving the employability of participants.

Activities:
Key activities: 

● GIS training sessions for 15 participants, where they learned OpenStreetMap editing tools and advanced GIS software like JOSM and QGIS.
● Organized mapathons and outreach events, including the OSM GEO-Week with University of Prishtina, and meetups with local and international experts.
● Signed MoUs with the Kosovo Cadastral Agency and municipalities to obtain geographical data, leading to the completion of Kosovo street names on OSM.
● Established OSM Kosovo Local Chapter and received support from the OSM Foundation to further expand the community and map settlements.
