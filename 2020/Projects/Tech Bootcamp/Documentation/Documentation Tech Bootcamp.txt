Title: Tech Bootcamp
	
Project description:

The Tech Bootcamp project by FLOSSK aimed to bridge the gap between market needs and the educational system in Kosovo by providing intensive, bootcamp-style training to youth. It featured two main tracks: a generic track for high school students teaching basic web development skills, and a specialized track for university students and recent graduates focused on specific programming technologies. The generic track aimed to train 140 high school students, while the specialized track targeted 24 university students, preparing them for entry-level positions in local software development firms. The project sought to address the lack of employable skills among youth entering the IT sector and to establish a pipeline of trained young professionals ready to meet the demands of the job market.
